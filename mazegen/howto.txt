also, replace # with |

First, run:
(MUST BE ODD)
python maze.py [r+2] [c+2] > [yourOutputFile.txt]

Then, do the following:

both cornors add start and end chars 'x' and 'o', remove if needed.

I recomend using sublime text to select cursor upward, then delete the colom of bad stuff on the right.

delete the last row, and your set.

ex, to get a 99x99 maze:

python maze.py 97 97 > maze.txt
